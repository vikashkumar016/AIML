Learning Objectives Achieved
1. Array Fundamentals

Creating NumPy arrays from Python lists
Understanding array vs list performance differences
Working with different data types and automatic type conversion
Multi-dimensional array creation and manipulation

2. Array Creation Techniques
python# Various methods explored
np.array([1,2,3,4])           # From lists
np.arange(1,11)               # Range generation
np.zeros((4,8))               # Initialized arrays
np.ones((6,6))                # All ones
np.linspace(1,5,3)            # Linear spacing
np.random.rand(5)             # Random arrays
3. Array Properties and Methods

Shape, size, and dtype attributes
Statistical operations: min(), max(), sum(), mean(), std()
Axis-specific operations (row-wise and column-wise calculations)
Finding indices with argmax() and argmin()

4. Indexing and Slicing

Single element access and range slicing
Multi-dimensional indexing with [row, column] notation
Boolean indexing for conditional data selection
Advanced slicing techniques

5. Array Operations

Element-wise arithmetic operations
Broadcasting between arrays and scalars
Matrix multiplication using @ operator and np.dot()
Transpose operations with .T

6. Advanced Manipulation

Array stacking (vertical, horizontal, column-wise)
Array splitting operations
Memory management concepts (shallow vs deep copy)

Practical Applications
Project 1: Sudoku Validator
Implemented a complete Sudoku validation system:

Validates all rows sum to 45
Checks all columns sum to 45
Verifies each 3x3 sub-grid sums to 45
Uses efficient array slicing and sum operations

Project 2: Student Data Analysis
Comprehensive grade analysis system processing student data:
Data Structure: [Age, Math Marks, Science Marks]
Implemented Features:

Calculate average age across all students
Extract subject-specific marks
Find highest scores and identify top performers
Filter students based on performance criteria
Apply bulk operations (grade adjustments)
Conditional data replacement and cleaning

Sample Operations:
python# Find students who scored above 90 in math
high_performers = data[data[:,1] > 90]

# Calculate subject-wise averages
subject_averages = np.mean(data[:,1:], axis=0)

# Filter students meeting multiple criteria
top_students = data[(data[:,1] >= 80) & (data[:,2] >= 80)]
